# COURSE REGISTRATION SYSTEM

This project focuses on addressing the key challenges associated with course registration, such as managing course information, student details, registration requests, and generating relevant reports. With our system, students can easily browse through available courses, submit registration requests, and track their enrollment status. On the other hand, administrators can effortlessly handle registration requests, allocate classrooms and instructors, and generate comprehensive reports for analysis and decision-making.

Coming to project goals we had to develop a course registration system using java jdbc rest mysql and other technologies to allow students to select courses and register in them using various payement techniques

Actors in our project include admin student and professor where professor can choose subjects to teach and admin manages the administration and controls the approval section.

The Course Registration System is designed to replace traditional manual methods with an electronic system that eliminates paperwork, reduces errors, and enhances the overall efficiency of course enrollment. By leveraging the power of Java programming language, we have created a feature-rich application that provides a seamless experience for all users involved.
